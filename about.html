  <h1>ABOUT</h1>

  <p style="font-size: 1.6em"> I'm listening to all of Rolling Stone's <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a> from #500 to #1. </p>

  <p> Why? If you know me, you know I'm into a media consumption project! In 2025 I watched all of Emma Stone's films (over the course of several months) and listened to all of Taylor Swift albums (over the course of a long weekend). These endeavours taught me that having a media consumption project is fun! And it helps me battle my arch nemesis: decision fatigue. Hopefully this mega-project won't turn me off the idea entirely. </p>

  <p> So, what are my goals with all this? I hope it will be cool to listen a variety of (hopefully) excellent music. Do I completely trust the Rolling Stone editors? No, but maybe they know something. (And they're keeping me from having to decide anything, which, as we've covered, is important.) I don't have a goal for how fast to complete this, but secretly I want to finish in 2026. Also, I hope my project starts a conversation! So ask me how I feel like it's going or fight me on one of my opinions! </p>

  <p> If you couldn't already tell, be sure to watch this space! I'm updating this website every time I start a new album. I'll also be adding reviews. I'm doing this using shortcuts on my phone, which is all very exciting. If you like my website or want to learn more about how this project works technically, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/jo-schroeder/500albumsproject">codebase on GitHub.</a> </p>
